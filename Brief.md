# Monopoly Clone
### Recreating a classic board game

This project is to recreate the board game Monopoly, with the aim of learning more about different programming paradigms, architectures and design patterns. 

Your lecturers will be working on two versions, one in C++ and another in JavaScript. 

You can work alongside them, developing a version in whatever language, and with any tech stack, you like. You should however, try and stick to the following restrictions:

- Develop a version for the command line first. This should allow a user to play the game using only the keyboard as input and text as output. 
- Also develop a version with a UI. This should use the same logic as the command line version, so that a user may use either interface to play, using the same codebase. 

Try not to use the same stack, and approach as the lecturers. Doing the same work in a different way will give you a good opportunity to learn through refactoring, code reviews, and comparison. 


Part 1: Write your own version (or as much as you can) in a language of your choice identifying techniques you use as you go.  Come together as a group to regularly discuss your choices, the pros and cons and also review your coding style and object model choices.

Tips: 
 * Do a design thinking session on the object, actions and relationships involved.
 * Reflect on peers decisions in contrast with your own, what are the pros and cons.


**Before moving on to part 2, check with the delivery team.**

Part 2: Work as a team to then select one of the code bases to then transfer to a UI interface of some kind.  This should be done in through agile project management and you should be working off of the same repository using branching as required.  Compare the new version against the old one.  How much of the codebase did you have to change?  Where did you have to put in the most work?  How did you test your code and the UI?


### Extra learning opportunities

The versions that your lecturers create will be used to demonstrate some of the principles of Object Oriented Programming. You may wish to take a similar approach, or you may wish to follow some [other programming paradigm](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~leavens/ComS541Fall97/hw-pages/paradigms/major.html).

You may also wish to start learning about different architectures that are used in programming. This is a **big** topic, and one that you should not expect to learn fully during the course of this project. One of the most well known architectures, Model-View-Controller (MVC), is the sort of thing whereyou could ask five different software developers and get five different explanations of it. Martin Fowler has [a blog post](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html) that I think is one of the most balanced discussion of the topic, though it's pretty heavy going!

### Evidence to gather

This project is an _excellent_ opportunity for videos of code reviews, and some screencasts of you presenting your understanding of the concepts discussed. Try and focus on broadening out they types of evidence that you are creating during this period.
